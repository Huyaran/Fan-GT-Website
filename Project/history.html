            September 12:<br>
            Labose 2nd administration. A total of 3 specimens. ‘Bae,’ ‘Litcom,’ ‘Handun.’ Litcom is 5 times that of Bae, and Handun is 15 times that of Litcom. <br>
            Bae and Litcom did not respond, and the Handun died from shock. It dies too quickly to find a trend.” <br>
            
            September 14:
            Labose 4th administration. A total of 5 test specimens. Four of these are Handun. Damn it.<br>
            
            October 21:<br>
            Labose 19th administration. A total of 21 specimens. Seems to be activated when exposed to air, but even without air it doesn't die. It just stays at rest.<br>
            
            October 25:<br>
            Labose 20th administration. The results of ‘Bae' and ‘Handun’ specimens are jagged. It would be nice if a larger and more complex arms and legs-type specimen could be obtained.<br>

            Bae, Litcom, Handun. They're all just freakin' noisy mice. They should have melted ages ago. Feels refreshing.<br>

            Mason, the vodka the management team ordered last week finally arrived today. Shit, shit, shit. I hope it's strong enough to erase yesterday's test results.

            First recorded in November 2030<br>
            
            The first person to die with this condition - Jason Colby, a 31-year-old male who was reported to be unemployed but actually works in the laundry 
            room of the L Institute, a top secret facility.<br>

            was infected with the Labose bacteria remaining on the protective clothing, which the L Institute was studying.<br>
            According to a document provided by an anonymous L lab researcher(See page 7), Labose bacteria cannot be stopped from being activated from dormancy
             and will decompose all organic organisms.<br>
            No one knew that Labose bacteria was accidentally leaked in the laboratory, or because of human behavior. Even the researchers have no way of 
            knowing where the lead researcher and [Redacted] are, authorities are trying to track them down.<br>
            Please avoid any internal or external leakage of this document, otherwise it may be detrimental to the country. If leaked, the leaker will be 
            punished with the most severe punishment. <br>

        <p> 850 - A crooked picture with a portrait drawn by a child with crayons. Above it was the caption "Mummy and Daddy are sleepy bugs."<br>

            The background of the picture is a blue sky with white clouds in the sky.<br>
            On the right is a yellow circle surrounded by curved lines that looks like the sun.<br>
            There was a couple lying on a bed directly under the sun, and they looked peaceful. Their necks were coated with a bumpy black substance that looked like running tar.<br>
            
            There is a child in the corner opposite the bed. She is wearing a suspender skirt and her hair is tied in a ponytail, and her face could not be seen 
            clearly because it was painted black.<br>
            A speech bubble above her head says "Mommy, Daddy, I'm hungry."<br>
            
            There is an adult-like handwriting on the back of the picture.
            "Emily, don't take off your gas mask anyway, just eat by yourself, then wash your hands and bring your mask back. If Mommy and Daddy don't wake up, 
            go to Aunt Julie, baby, you can do it, right?" <br>

            "[Dashboard beep] [Alarm siren] All personnel in the research building, please pay attention. The Labose research building is about to be blocked due to 
            leaks of woohoo bacteria. All researchers are requested to evacuate quickly by the vehicle in the um um research institute."<br>
            
            "[Alarm beep] This is not a disaster drill, notice again. All researchers must be evacuated immediately."<br>
            "[Alarm beep] See? Data, how can this happen. [Dashboard beep] Repeated notice that all researchers must evacuate within two minutes. After two minutes, 
            the security system will automatically turn on and block the entire research building."<br>

            After hearing a loud bang of a heavy object falling, only the siren beeps, and there is no more human voice.<br>
            "[Dashboard beep] [Device beep] Permission confirmed and unblocked. Starting the bacteria release system."<br>
